# D365 Organization Editor
Dynamics 365 stores configuration values for the environment in the `Organization` entity. These fields are updated when changes are made in the `System > Administration > System Settings` window, although not all settings are present here

Examples of fields that are not available in the System Settings are:
- __IsFolderAutoCreatedonSP__: Select whether folders should be automatically created on SharePoint.
- __AllowLegacyClientExperience__: Enable access to legacy web client UI

This solution provides a way to update the fields in the organization entity without writing a console app

The fields shown in the editor are retrieved from the metadata, so any fields that are added to the organization entity will be shown

Some fields cannot be directly edited, and these fields will not be shown, for example `CreatedOn`

(Set the values at your own risk)
